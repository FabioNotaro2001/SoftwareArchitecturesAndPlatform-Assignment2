# SoftwareArchitecturesAndPlatform-Assignment2

This repository contains the implementation for Assignment 2 of the Software Architectures and Platform course. The project demonstrates the application of microservices architecture using Docker and Docker Compose.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several microservices, each with its own directory:

- `admin-gui`: Admin interface for managing the platform.
- `apigateway`: API Gateway for routing requests to appropriate services.
- `ebikes-manager`: Service for managing electric bikes.
- `end2end-test`: End-to-end tests for the platform.
- `registry`: Service registry for microservices discovery.
- `rides-manager`: Service for managing rides.
- `user-gui`: User interface for interacting with the platform.
- `users-manager`: Service for managing users.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose:contentReference[oaicite:25]{index=25}

## Getting Started

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FabioNotaro2001/SoftwareArchitecturesAndPlatform-Assignment2.git
   cd SoftwareArchitecturesAndPlatform-Assignment2

Build and start the services using Docker Compose:
docker-compose up --build

    Access the services:

        Admin GUI: http://localhost:8081
